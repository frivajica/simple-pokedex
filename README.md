# Spootify Coding Challenge üéß

### Difficulty: Medium

# Goals/Outcomes ‚ú®
- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently

# Pre-requisites ‚úÖ
- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to `config.js`
  - Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**

# Requirements üìñ
- Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display *Browse* genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- Loading state/UI *(optional, current UX is already clean)*
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button
  - Utilise the *existing* dark-mode scss file by adding a `dark-mode` class to the root `html` element
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.

# Think about üí°
- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

# What's Already Been Done üèÅ
- UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)
- A Spotify request helper (`makeRequest.js`)

# Screenshots üåÑ
